# My Retrospective on Our First Project
## What did I accomplish ?
- I believe that I accomplished alot in terms of the UX design of the application, I incorporated a bunch of different styles and functions, through CSS and BootStrap to really bring the app alive.



- I also did pretty well at using our teams idea of the page and brining it to life.

## What did I Struggle With ?

- I could of done better with the implimentation of our buttons I needed alot of help from other class mates not just my team mates to get our buttons to work properly.

- I could have also done better at cleaning up my code it was functional but very muddy I want to get better at making my code more readable.
